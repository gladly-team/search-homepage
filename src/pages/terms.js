        <p>
          Below are our Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms") that govern Tab
          for a Cause's relationship with its users and others who interact with
          tab.gladly.io (the "Website") and any information, text, graphics,
          photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the
          Website (collectively referred to as "Content"). This document applies
          to Tab for a Cause ("Tab for a Cause", "us", "our", or "we"), and by
          using the Website in any way, you agree to these Terms in their
          entirety. If you have any questions, please{' '}

        </p>

        <h2>1. Payments to Causes</h2>
        <p>
          Tab for a Cause's mission is the payment of advertising revenue
          generated to nonprofit charity organizations ("Cause" or "Causes")
          that users care about. The following terms govern Tab for a Cause's
          payments to Causes:
        </p>
        <p>
          Any "Raised", "Given", and "Earned" dollar amounts are our Team's
          good-faith projections of how much advertising revenue users have
          earned based on their usage of the Tab for a Cause website. Please
          note that in the case that Tab for a Cause does not receive payment
          from its partners for any reason, including but not limited to
          advertisement click-fraud, Tab for a Cause is not responsible for
          making any payments to Causes and reserves the right to modify the
          displayed dollar amounts accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tab for a Cause's payments to Causes are made within 120 days of the
          end of every fiscal quarter. Any displayed dollar amount "Raised",
          "Given", or "Earned" simply indicates that Tab for a Cause has
          designated funds for payment to a particular cause, and in no way
          reflects when the cause actually receives these funds.
        </p>
        <p>
          All dollar amounts listed on the Website represent United States
          Dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Tab for a Cause makes payments of user-generated funds to the
          causes users designate, all user-generated funds are considered the
          wholly-owned revenue of Tab for a Cause and all payments to Causes are
          considered payments directly from Tab for a Cause to the designated
          Causes. Users have no legal claim to redeem these funds from Tab for a
          Cause, nor any legal claim to exert control over these funds in any
          way. Users must be aware that they may not legally attempt to deduct
          from their taxes any amounts "raised" on Tab for a Cause and that to
          do so may be illegal in the user's tax jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Selection and Continuance of Causes</h2>
        <p>
          Causes that operate on the Website are selected based on whether they:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            are geographically broad in scope (for example, national or
            international in scope)
          </li>
          <li>
            are 501(c)(3) organizations maintain accessible and transparent
            financial statements
          </li>
          <li>
            are top-rated for efficiency by a third-party Cause evaluator (for
            example, rated 3 or 4 stars on CauseNavigator.org). We may relax
            this criterion in some situations, such as when the Cause has not
            yet been evaluated by third-party evaluators.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Tab for a Cause reserves all rights to choose the Causes that are to
          operate on the Website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tab for a Cause reserves the right to remove a Cause from its website
          or discontinue all payments to a Cause at any time and without reason.
          In such a case, Tab for a Cause will evenly distribute that Cause's
          unpaid earnings to all other Causes on the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          If at any time the administration of a Cause for which Tab for a Cause
          raises revenue requests that Tab for a Cause remove the Cause from the
          Website or discontinue all payments to said Cause, Tab for a Cause
          will comply within fourteen (14) days from the date of receiving a
          written request from a verifiable member of the Cause's
          administration. In such a case, Tab for a Cause will evenly distribute
          that Cause's unpaid earnings to all other Causes on the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          By listing a Cause on its website or raising revenue for a Cause, Tab
          for a Cause does not necessarily imply any formal relationship with
          that Cause. Tab for a Cause is not operated by any members of
          administration from the Causes listed on the Website.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Reproduction and Display of Content</h2>
        <p>
          Tab for a Cause, to the best of its knowledge, does not reproduce or
          display any content to which Tab for a Cause does not have the right
          to reproduce or display.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any photos or written content reproduced from other sources are photos
          or written content that were explicity licensed with a Creative
          Commons license for commercial use at the time of their obtainment.
        </p>
        <p>
          All users must agree to owning all rights to their submitted content
          and give Tab for a Cause the right to reproduce and display that
          content on the website and in all marketing material. User-submitted
          content is reproduced and displayed on good faith that the user who
          submitted the content owned all rights to the content.
        </p>
        <p>
          If at any time a the owner of any content reproduced or displayed on
          the Website requests that the owner's content be removed from the
          Website, Tab for a Cause will comply with that request within fourteen
          (14) days of receiving the request. Tab for a Cause may require
          evidence of the user's ownership of the material prior to complying
          with the request.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Referral Program</h2>
        <p>
          For the Referral Program, Tab for a Cause will distribute "Referral
          Links" to the Tab for a Cause community. A "Referral Link" is a unique
          url for you to distribute to eligible friends, family and other third
          parties (each, a "Referred User"). If a Referred User uses your
          Referral Link to sign up and become a user of Tab for a Cause, then
          the Referred User shall be considered a "Qualifying User" and you will
          be eligible for the referral reward. Tab for a Cause will at its sole
          discretion determine which Referred Users are approved as Qualifying
          Users on Tab for a Cause.
        </p>
